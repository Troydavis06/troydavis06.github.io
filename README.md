# Troy Davis â€“ Personal Website  

Welcome to my personal website! This site showcases my projects, experience, and interests in computer science and mathematics.  

## Important Notice
Recently, I decided that I no longer like the format of this website whatsoever. With that being said, whenever I get some more time on my hands, I will be completely revamping this website to have a more simplistic appearance and will also make adding experience/projects a much more user-friendly experience for me.
